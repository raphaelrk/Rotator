Rotator tests how well you can say things backwards
Record yourself saying something forwards, record yourself saying the same thing backwards, and then listen as Rotator plays them back to you at the same time.

It's written in Processing, uses minim and array-flipping for its audio and audio manipulation, and finds the offset of the backwards audio by searching for the offset that results in the lowest variance from the forwards audio.

Rotator was written at CodeDay Chicago 2015, where it won Best Application
