Rotator tests how well you can say things backwards
Rotator records you saying something forwards and backwards then scores how close they were and lets you hear them played over each other

It's written in Processing, uses minim and array-flipping for its audio and audio manipulation, and finds the offset of the backwards audio by searching for the offset that results in the lowest variance from the forwards audio.

Rotator was written at CodeDay Chicago 2015, where it won Best Application
